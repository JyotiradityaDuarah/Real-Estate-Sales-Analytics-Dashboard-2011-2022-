🏘 Real Estate Sales Analytics Dashboard (2011–2022)
Project Overview

This project analyzes over a decade of real estate transaction data (2011–2022) to uncover trends in property sales, valuation alignment, and town-level performance.

The objective was to design an interactive Tableau dashboard that enables municipal planning stakeholders to explore:

Sales growth trends

Geographic concentration of transactions

Property type composition

Valuation efficiency using Sales Ratio metrics

The final output is a parameter-driven, interactive dashboard with a structured analytical narrative.

Dataset

The dataset contains transactional-level records including:

Sale Amount

Assessed Value

Sales Ratio

Town

Property Type

Residential Type

Date Recorded (2011–2022)

Each row represents a single property transaction.

Key Analytical Questions

How have real estate sales evolved over time?

Which towns drive the highest transaction value?

How does property composition influence total sales?

Where do assessed values diverge from market prices?

Is transaction activity concentrated or distributed evenly?
